## About the project

This project is focused on creating a minimalistic but attractive website for connecting customers with home service professionals. Based on the popular platform [UrbanCompany](https://www.urbancompany.com/bangalore) (erstwhile UrbanClap), this project is mostly focused on the design and responsiveness of the website. Though no backend work is present at the moment, this can easily serve as a front-end template for a full-stack project.

Attached below are a few screenshots of this site -
